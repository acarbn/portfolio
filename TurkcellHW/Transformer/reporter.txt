## Results

Different models and parameters were tested for the task. 

Although resulted similar mean ROUGE-L scores, facebook/bart-base trained with Trainer for 6 epochs resulted the best performance. 

However when the hughlight labels were cleaned, the predictions resulted non-sentence outputs. 

Therefore the model was re-trained from not cleaned labels so that it will provide full sentence summaries.
